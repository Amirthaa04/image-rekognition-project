# üñºÔ∏è Image Recognition on Amazon S3 Using AWS Rekognition

This project demonstrates how to perform object and scene detection on images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket using **Amazon Rekognition** and **boto3** in Python. It runs entirely from **AWS CloudShell** ‚Äî no EC2 or local setup required!

---

## üìå Features

- Connects to Amazon Rekognition via `boto3`
- Detects up to 10 object labels per image
- Parses bounding boxes, confidence scores, and parent labels
- Executed securely in CloudShell with IAM-based access
